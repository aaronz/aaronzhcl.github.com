<p><strong>Add a Simple Google, Yahoo! or Bing Search Box to Your Website<&#47;strong></p>

&lsquo;Search&rsquo; is the web&rsquo;s most utilized and essential function. The major search engines process billions of keyword requests daily, but there are still some websites and blogs that have yet to incorporate the vital feature.</p>
<p>While customized search box solutions are offered by various business entities, I prefer to use only the results from major engines: Google, Yahoo!, or Bing. Many of the commercial packages employ a free trial period to entice buyers, which tends to include very prominently placed ads, a possible turn off for some of your site visitors.</p>
<p><strong>Google Custom Search Engine<&#47;strong></p>

<p>With Google Custom Search, add a search box to your homepage to help people find what they need on your website.</p>
