This kind of issue is typically occurs when the ASP.NET request executes for a period of time longer than the maximum timeout period allowed for server-side code execution.</p>
<p>This maximum timeout period can be set by executionTimeout attribute of httpRuntime element in config file. (The default value is 110 seconds in .Net 4.0)</p>

This issue typically occurs when the ASP.NET request executes for a period of time longer than the maximum timeout period allowed for server-side code execution.<br />
My customer knows it will take 5 minutes to execute his ASP.NET page because the page needs to retrieve large data from database to generate a report. Therefore he has already set the value of executionTimeout attribute of httpRuntime element to 600 seconds in web.config. However he still receives HttpException &ldquo;Request timed out&rdquo; error while the ASP.NET page executes for 2 or 3 minutes.</p>
